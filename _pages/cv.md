<!-- Work Experience -->
<!-- ====== -->
* **Machine Learning Research** - Intern, [Bosch AI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/), Mar 2023 - Aug 2022 
  <!-- * March to August 2023 -->
  * Supervisor: [Zhenzhen Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6LYI6uUAAAAJ&hl=en)
  *	Formulated pFairness, a pioneering fairness metric for evaluating industrial-scale Federated Learning applications, coupled with a framework that integrates personalized, groupwise, and shared models, successfully validated on Cifar10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, resulting in substantial improvements with a 20% performance increase.
  *	Proposed the FedTPG algorithm, a federated approach for generating context-aware prompt vectors from text inputs, significantly enhancing the generalization capability of Large Language-Vision Models like CLIP, especially in diverse data classification tasks under the distributed non-iid Language-Vision tasks, accepted as FL@FM-NeurIPS’23 Oral.
  *	Mentored incoming summer interns, guiding them through project onboarding, familiarization with the code base, and research project initiation, ensuring a smooth and effective integration into the team.
