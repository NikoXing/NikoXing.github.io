I am Xingyu Li, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.msstate.edu/), Mississippi State University, working with Prof. [Bo Tang](https://my.ece.msstate.edu/faculty/tang/). I received my Master's degree from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2017, and my Bachelor's degree from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2015. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineering - Intern at [Devron](https://devron.ai/), concentrating on developing algorithms for the cross-silo Federated Learning scenario. 

My research focuses on deep learning theories and algorithms, in the area of continual lifelong learning for bio-inspired artificial intelligence and federated learning for privacy-enhancing technology.
