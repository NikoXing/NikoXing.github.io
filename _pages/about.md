I am Xingyu Li, a Ph.D. at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.msstate.edu/), Mississippi State University, working with Prof. [Bo Tang](https://users.wpi.edu/~btang1/). I received my Master's degree from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2017, and my Bachelor's degree from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2015. Currently, I work on Machine Learning Research at [Bosch](https://www.bosch-ai.com/), concentrating on research project for the distributed, heterogeneous machine learning scenarios.

My research focuses on deep learning theories and algorithms, in the area of continual lifelong learning for bio-inspired artificial intelligence and federated learning for privacy-enhancing technology.
