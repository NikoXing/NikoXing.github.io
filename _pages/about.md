<span style="color:red">I am currently job hunting for positions at Fall 2024. If you are interested in my research and work experience, please feel free to contact me! 
</span>

I am Xingyu Li, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Computer Science](https://sse.tulane.edu/cs/), Tulane University, collaborating with Prof. [Lu Peng](https://cs.tulane.edu/~lpeng3/) in pioneering research related to Secure and Private Machine Learning, specifically tailored for Medical and Healthcare applications. 

I earned my Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.msstate.edu/), Mississippi State University in May 2023, where I was under the distinguished supervision from Prof. [Bo Tang](https://users.wpi.edu/~btang1/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Master's degree from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2017 and obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2015. 

Between March and August 2023, I undertook a role as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Bosch](https://www.bosch-ai.com/). My contributions there centered on advancing foundational models for distributed and heterogeneous machine learning scenarios. Additionally, I gained practical experience as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Devron](https://www.devron.ai/) from August and December 2022, where I worked on federated learning applications for financial fraud detection and COVID-19 tracking.

My scholarly contributions primarily revolve around the following domains:

1. **Federated Learning:** Investigating the decentralized architecture for machine learning to enhance data privacy and model efficacy.
2. **Secure and Private Machine Learning:** Exploring techniques to safeguard data and model integrity.
3. **Machine Learning Generalization on Foundational Models:** Assessing the adaptability and scalability of large foundation models.
4. **Continual Lifelong Learning:** Developing bio-inspired artificial intelligence systems that adapt and learn throughout their lifetimes.
